# Octiax
Octiax password manager

This project is certainly not completed. I will update Octiax feasibly and periodically. Some features I have in mind are adding a UI to seeYourPasswords.java and combining it with Main.java as a method and adding salts to the hashed site names for additional security.

One external library was used: [commons-codec](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/commons-codec/commons-codec/)
