# Octiax
Octiax password manager

This project is certainly not completed. I will update Octiax feasibly and periodically. Some features I have in mind are adding a GUI to [seeYourPasswords.java](https://github.com/Encryptegral25/Octiax/blob/main/seeYourPasswords.java) and combining it with [Main.java](https://github.com/Encryptegral25/Octiax/blob/main/Main.java) as a method and hashing the site-names with salt for additional security (which presently are hashed with the SHA-256 algorithm without any salt or pepper).

One external library was used: [commons-codec](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/commons-codec/commons-codec/)
